    <string name="about_me_text">In my last job I worked as a quality auditor for Sanoh UK. I was made redundant at the end of March 2019. This was due to a reduction cars being built, and therefore parts required. I was working evening shifts, which were being greatly reduced, and Sanoh did not feel that they needed anyone from quality on that shift. Since redundancy I have been studying to help improve my programming and maths skills.\n
        Whist working for Sanoh I studied with the Open University. The courses have been on computing and IT. In 2012 I achieved a degree. On my way to the degree I obtained a Diploma in Computing and two certificates.\n
        One of the main reasons for studying, along with the sense of achievement and interest in the subject, was to change career and work in the areas of computing and IT. My main area of interest is Java programming. This is due to the language, plus learning about object orientated programming, being a major aspect of my study. Plus the programming aspects were the most challenging, fulfilling and enjoyable part of my study. In my final year of OU study I programmed for the Android mobile operating system. I find mobile development very interesting and continue to create apps.</string>

    <string name="computing_project_text">My final year of study included the Computing And IT Project. Unlike other courses the study area was largely left up to the student (as long as it fitted in with previous courses). I chose to write programs for the Google Android mobile operating system. This is done with Java using a SDK from Google.\n
        The basic idea was to build two apps that would test the idea that personal navigation could be done via phones vibration function. Advantages of this is that the user is concentrating on the world around them, not their phone. Also, as the phone is not in public view, risk of theft is reduced. \
        Programming these apps involved a lot of research into programming for Android. The second app also used the Google maps API.\n
        As well as programming the final report also contained use cases, state machine diagram, activity diagram, code beautification and descriptions of how the code was created via prototyping (Scope/Design, Notes on the programming, Testing). \n
        Unlike other OU courses I was left largely to work on my own. This was challenging as well as rewarding. Seeing the second app slowly be built from a simple map showing my location, to a route that had twenty proximity alerts (used for volunteer testing) was hugely satisfying.\n
